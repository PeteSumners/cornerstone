# Schumann Resonance Audio Integration

## Overview

The Schumann Resonances are electromagnetic resonances generated by lightning discharges in the cavity between Earth's surface and the ionosphere. The fundamental frequency is **7.83 Hz**, often called Earth's "heartbeat."

This document describes how to integrate Schumann resonance frequencies into Cornerstone's audio system for ambient soundscapes, background music, and therapeutic gameplay experiences.

## The Science

### Discovery
- **Discovered by:** German physicist W.O. Schumann (1950s)
- **Phenomenon:** Global electromagnetic resonances in Earth-ionosphere cavity
- **Generated by:** ~2000 thunderstorms worldwide producing ~50 lightning flashes/second

### Frequency Spectrum

| Harmonic | Frequency | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1st (Fundamental) | 7.83 Hz | Primary resonance, strongest |
| 2nd | 14.3 Hz | First harmonic |
| 3rd | 20.8 Hz | Second harmonic |
| 4th | 27.3 Hz | Third harmonic |
| 5th | 33.8 Hz | Fourth harmonic |
| 6th | 39.0 Hz | Fifth harmonic |
| 7th | 45.0 Hz | Sixth harmonic |

**Pattern:** Higher harmonics spaced at ~6.5 Hz intervals

### Human Connection

The 7.83 Hz frequency closely matches:
- **Alpha brain waves** (8-12 Hz): Relaxed, meditative state
- **Theta brain waves** (4-8 Hz): Deep meditation, creativity
- Natural human biological rhythms

## Claimed Benefits

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** These are wellness claims, not scientifically proven medical facts.

Reported benefits include:
- Deep relaxation and stress reduction
- Enhanced meditation and mindfulness
- Improved focus and mental clarity

## Audio Implementation Strategies

### Strategy 1: Binaural Beats

**How it works:**
- Play different frequencies in each ear
- Brain perceives the difference as a "beat"
- Example: 200 Hz (left) + 207.83 Hz (right) = 7.83 Hz perceived beat

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Left ear: Base frequency
leftChannel: 200 Hz sine wave

// Right ear: Base frequency + 7.83 Hz
rightChannel: 207.83 Hz sine wave

// Brain perceives: 7.83 Hz binaural beat
```

**Advantages:**
✅ Works with standard speakers/headphones
✅ Perceptible by human hearing
✅ Easy to implement with Web Audio API

### Strategy 2: Isochronic Tones

**How it works:**
- Rapidly pulsing sound at target frequency
- Turns on/off at 7.83 Hz rate
- More intense than binaural beats

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Pulse a carrier frequency at 7.83 Hz
carrierFrequency: 200 Hz
modulationFrequency: 7.83 Hz (pulse rate)
```

### Strategy 3: Harmonic Layering

**How it works:**
- Layer multiple Schumann harmonics
- Create rich, natural-sounding ambient texture
- Mirrors natural Schumann resonances

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Fundamental
layer1: 7.83 Hz × 32 = 250.56 Hz

// Harmonics
layer2: 14.3 Hz × 32 = 457.6 Hz
layer3: 20.8 Hz × 32 = 665.6 Hz
layer4: 27.3 Hz × 32 = 873.6 Hz

// Mix together for ambient drone
```

### Strategy 4: Amplitude Modulation

**How it works:**
- Modulate volume of a carrier frequency
- Creates subtle pulsing effect
- Very gentle, barely noticeable

**Implementation:**
```javascript
carrierFrequency: 432 Hz (A = 432 Hz tuning)
amplitudeModulation: 7.83 Hz (volume pulse)
```

## Implementation in Cornerstone

### Use Cases

#### 1. Background Ambience
- Constant 7.83 Hz binaural beat
- Very quiet (5-10% volume)
- Plays during exploration
- Creates calming atmosphere

#### 2. Meditation Zones
- Certain areas trigger Schumann tones
- Prayer/reflection locations
- Bible verse reading areas
- Increased intensity (20-30% volume)

#### 3. Dynamic Music System
- Base all music on Schumann harmonics
- 7.83 Hz = rhythmic pulse base
- Harmonics = melodic structure
- Creates coherent, healing soundscape

#### 4. Time-of-Day Variation
- Morning: Higher harmonics (20.8, 27.3 Hz)
- Midday: Balanced mix
- Evening: Lower harmonics (7.83, 14.3 Hz)
- Night: Pure 7.83 Hz fundamental

#### 5. Player State Modulation
- Low health: Slower, deeper tones
- Meditation/prayer: Pure 7.83 Hz
- Combat: Higher harmonics (energy)
- Building: Mid-range harmonics (focus)

## Web Audio API Implementation

See `schumann-audio-generator.js` for full implementation.

### Basic Example

```javascript
const audioContext = new AudioContext();

// Create binaural beat at 7.83 Hz
function createSchumannBinauralBeat(baseFreq = 200) {
  // Left channel
  const leftOsc = audioContext.createOscillator();
  leftOsc.frequency.value = baseFreq;

  // Right channel (7.83 Hz higher)
  const rightOsc = audioContext.createOscillator();
  rightOsc.frequency.value = baseFreq + 7.83;

  // Pan to stereo
  const leftPanner = audioContext.createStereoPanner();
  leftPanner.pan.value = -1; // Full left

  const rightPanner = audioContext.createStereoPanner();
  rightPanner.pan.value = 1; // Full right

  // Connect and play
  leftOsc.connect(leftPanner).connect(audioContext.destination);
  rightOsc.connect(rightPanner).connect(audioContext.destination);

  leftOsc.start();
  rightOsc.start();

  return { leftOsc, rightOsc };
}
```

## Important Considerations

### ⚠️ Safety and Ethics

1. **No Constant Static Frequencies**
   - Natural Schumann resonances fluctuate
   - Continuous static frequencies don't exist in nature
   - Implement subtle variation (±0.5 Hz)

2. **Volume Levels**
   - Keep very quiet (barely audible)
   - Never louder than other game audio
   - Should be subliminal, not dominant

3. **User Control**
   - Always allow users to disable
   - Provide volume slider
   - Respect accessibility needs

4. **Disclosure**
   - Inform users about Schumann frequencies
   - Don't make medical claims
   - Be transparent about purpose

### 🎵 Audio Design Best Practices

1. **Don't overuse**
   - Not every area needs it
   - Use strategically
   - Less is more

2. **Blend naturally**
   - Mix with ambient sounds
   - Wind, water, nature sounds
   - Not pure synthetic tones

3. **Add variation**
   - Slowly shift between harmonics
   - Add natural fluctuation
   - Prevent monotony

4. **Test with users**
   - Some find it calming
   - Others may find it annoying
   - Always allow opt-out

## Biblical Integration

Schumann resonances connect well with biblical themes:

### 1. Creation Theme
- **Genesis 1:** God's creative voice
- **Psalm 19:** "The heavens declare the glory of God"
- Schumann = Earth's "voice," a testament to creation

### 2. Rest and Sabbath
- **Exodus 20:8-11:** Remember the Sabbath
- **Matthew 11:28:** "Come to me... and I will give you rest"
- 7.83 Hz promotes rest and meditation

### 3. Grounding and Foundation
- **Psalm 127:1:** "Unless the LORD builds the house..."
- **Matthew 7:24:** Building on rock (solid foundation)
- Schumann = grounding frequency, connection to Earth

### 4. Healing and Peace
- **Psalm 23:** "He restores my soul"
- **John 14:27:** "Peace I leave with you"
- Calming frequencies support spiritual peace

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Generated Worship Music

Use Schumann harmonics to generate procedural worship music:

```javascript
// Base rhythm: 7.83 Hz = ~468 BPM / 60 = 7.8 beats/sec
// Slow down: 7.83 / 4 = ~1.96 Hz = ~117 BPM (slow, meditative)

const worshipTempo = 7.83 / 4; // ~2 Hz, ~120 BPM

// Melody notes based on harmonics
const notes = [
  7.83 * 32,  // 250.56 Hz
  14.3 * 32,  // 457.6 Hz
  20.8 * 32,  // 665.6 Hz
  // etc.
];
```

### Seasonal Variations

Actual Schumann resonances vary by season, time of day, and solar activity:

- **Spring:** Slightly higher frequencies
- **Summer:** More intense
- **Fall:** Moderate
- **Winter:** Slightly lower
- **Solar storms:** Increased intensity

Implement these variations for realism!
